      ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ My 4 year old daughter had a few lessons with him and she loves
      it! She just started learning piano and I believe that having a good
      teacher is very important to keep her interested in and motivated. He’s
      very professional, sweet, and organized with great personal communication
      skill. Highly recommended!
    </li>
    <li>
      ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ezra is very patient, knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.
      He’s made me feel comfortable with him and is teaching fundamentals of
      piano, reading music, and even some music theory. If I’ve been interested
      in a topic he’s either able to immediately support me or willing to go
      find the answers to the questions I’ve asked. Highly recommend.

      ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ezra is an excellent teacher because he is very focused on
      clearly and slowly explaining the information my daughter needs to
      understand in order to learn the piano well. He's very friendly and also
      very professional, in the way that is required to have a productive
      lesson.
